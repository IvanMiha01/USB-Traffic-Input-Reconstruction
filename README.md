# USB-Traffic-Input-Reconstruction-

This project focuses on reconstructing keyboard and mouse input from captured USB traffic (pcap files). Using Python and TShark, the program parses HID data packets, interprets keypress and mouse movement events, and outputs the reconstructed inputs as text and images. Originally inspired by forensic analysis and CTF challenges, this tool can aid in understanding USB HID communication and input reconstruction techniques.
